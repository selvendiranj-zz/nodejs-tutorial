# Getting Started

## Installation
* The official Node.js website has installation instructions for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Check for the version of the NodeJS and npm installed.
* ```node --version```
* ```npm --version```

## My First NodeJS

Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js on your computer, lets try to display "Hello World" in a web browser.

* Create a Node.js file named "hello-world.js", (refer the js file in Hands-Ons folder)

```javascript

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 8080;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

```

* Save the file on your computer
* The code tells the computer to write "Hello World!" if anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080.
* For now, you do not have to understand the code. It will be explained later.

## Initiate the Node.js File

* The file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place.
* Start your command line interface, write ```node hello-world.js``` and hit enter
* Now, your computer works as a server!
* If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!
* Start your internet browser, and type in the address: [localhost](http://localhost:8080)
