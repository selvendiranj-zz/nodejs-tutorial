# HTTP Module

### The Built-in HTTP Module
* Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
* To include the HTTP module, use the ```require('http')``` method

### Node.js as a Web Server
* The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
* Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:
* The function passed into the ```http.createServer()``` method, will be executed when someone tries to access the computer on port 8080.

### Add an HTTP Header
* If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML, you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type:
* The first argument of the ```res.writeHead()``` method is the status code, 200 means that all is OK, the second argument is an object containing the response headers.

### Read the Query String
* The function passed into the ```http.createServer()``` has a req argument that represents the request from the client, as an object (http.IncomingMessage object).
* This object has a property called "url" which holds the part of the url that comes after the domain name:
* ```http://localhost:8080/summer will output /summer```
* ```http://localhost:8080/winter will output /winter```

### Split the Query String
* There are built-in modules to easily split the query string into readable parts, such as the URL module.
* Will produce this result: ```Month Year```
