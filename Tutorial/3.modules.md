# Modules

### What is a Module in Node.js?

* It is the same as JavaScript libraries.
* A set of functions you want to include in your application.

### Built-in Modules

* Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
* Look at [Built-in Modules Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp) for a complete list of modules.

### Include Modules

* To include a module, use the **require()** function with the name of the module
* When you add http module, your application will have access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server

### Create Your Own Modules

* You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.
* Creates a module that returns a date and time object
* Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file.
* Save the code in a file called "date-module.js"
* Now you can include and use the module in any of your modules.js files.
* refer the module "date-module" in a Node.js file using ./<relativepath>
* run module.js from console

If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you will see the same result as:
```
The date and time are currently Day Mon dd yyyy hh:mm:ss (Time Zone)
```
